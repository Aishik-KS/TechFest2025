TechFest 2025 Project Idea

## Inspiration

We discovered that most fake news is propagated via social media platforms. Users often share articles without verifying their authenticity, driven by attention-grabbing headlines. We envisioned a service that enables users to quickly verify whether a link is legitimate or not. Our solution specifically targets Telegram, leveraging its bot functionality.

## What It Does

Our solution provides Telegram users with the ability to verify the authenticity of URLs before sharing. We have developed a working prototype and a proof of concept.

**Working Prototype:**

Before forwarding a link to others, users can send it to our Telegram bot. The bot processes the link and responds whether the content is trustworthy, providing users with an opportunity to make an informed decision.

**Conceptual Prototype (Proof of Concept/Not Functional):**

This version works similarly to the working prototype, with one key enhancement. Instead of users proactively checking links with the bot, the system prompts them whenever they attempt to forward a link. The prompt encourages users to verify the link with the bot, providing a moment for reflection before sharing. This reduces the likelihood of users spreading misinformation. Due to the need for changes to the Telegram UI, this feature is conceptual, and we have created a Figma prototype to demonstrate the idea.
